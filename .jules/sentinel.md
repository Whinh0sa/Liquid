## 2026-07-06 - [Express Error Handling Leak]
**Vulnerability:** Lack of global error handler in Express allows unhandled errors to expose stack traces, and lack of payload size limit exposes the application to DoS attacks.
**Learning:** Express 5 handles unhandled promise rejections natively, but without a custom error handler, it can still leak stack traces or internal errors to the client by default.
**Prevention:** Always implement a global error handler at the end of the Express middleware chain to log errors securely and return generic, safe JSON responses. Set payload limits on `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` to prevent large payload DoS.

## 2025-02-27 - Security Hardening of API Server
**Vulnerability:** The application lacked default HTTP security headers.
**Learning:** Using a simple middleware to set essential HTTP security headers offers an immediate defense-in-depth benefit without external dependencies.
**Prevention:** Introduce basic security headers directly or via a library like helmet at the project's inception.

\n- Overly permissive CORS configurations (e.g., `app.use(cors())`) allow all origins by default. Always configure CORS explicitly using environment variables like `CORS_ORIGIN`, and fallback securely based on the environment (e.g., restrict to `false` in production if the variable is missing).
